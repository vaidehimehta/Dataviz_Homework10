It is generated via
the file <code>index.idyll</code>. To compile this post using
idyll, run the command <code>idyll</code> inside of this directory.</p><p>Idyll posts are designed to support interaction and
data-driven graphics.</p><h1 id="builtin-components:-onclick">BuiltIn Components: onClick</h1><button>Click Me!</button><p>Variable value: <span class="idyll-display">0.00</span></p><h1 id="builtin-components:-dropdown">BuiltIn Components: Dropdown</h1><select options="Option1,Option2"><option selected="" value="Option1">Option1</option><option value="Option2">Option2</option></select><h2 id="vega-lite">Vega-lite</h2><div></div><p>Breif Explanation:</p><p>1) Where did you get the dataset?</p><p><span>A: The Affairs dataset can be found at <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html.">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html.</a></span></p><p>2) What is the data trying to measure?</p><p>A: The data is telling about the number of affairs males and females have and at what age they were married and number of children they have with some additional information</p><p>3) What are you trying to show in the plot?</p><p>A: The plot is telling about the number of years a person was married and total number of affairs they had. Though I couldn’t add appropriate scales to the axes. That is something I would like to look into working futher on the project.</p><p>Apart from that I explored some of the other interactions that can be done in idyll like dropdowns and radio buttons. I have added a dropdown menu just to try the code in this homework.</p><p>4) What vega-lite mark(s) you used and why?</p><p>A: The mark that was used was “bar” to depict the trend in data.</p></div></div></div></div>
